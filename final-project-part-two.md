# Wireframes / storyboards

## Story outline and flow
My story centers on the sharp rise in **Uzbekistan’s housing prices (2022–2024)**. I want to explore whether the influx of **Russian migrants acted as a catalyst**, while also situating this trend in the **regional context** (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) and considering **other demand/supply factors**.

## Storyboard walkthrough
1. **Hook (Hero panel)** – “Housing prices in Uzbekistan rose X% since 2021.” Hypothesis: migration as catalyst.  
2. **Regional context** – Indexed price lines for Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan (2018–2025).  
3. **Migration flows** – Arrivals of Russian citizens to each country, showing the 2022 spike.  
4. **Alignment panel** – Side-by-side: migration spike vs. price path (with vertical guides).  
5. **Drivers wall** – Demand: real income, population. Supply: building materials, housing stock.  
6. **Quick tags** – “Tracks trend” vs. “Breakout” indicators.  
7. **Limits & methods note** – Clarify association ≠ causation.  
8. **Feedback invitation** – Prompt for user reactions.  

## Wireframe notes
- Layout: sequential Shorthand flow, one storyboard section per element.  
- Design: indexed scales, direct labels, colorblind-safe hues, legends on top.  
- Accessibility: ≥12px tick labels, annotations over tooltips, consistent x-axes.  

**What changed from Part I**: I expanded from a single-country story to a **regional lens**, and added a **drivers wall** to explore alternative explanations. The idea is to check if non-migration factors followed historical trends—if so, migration becomes the plausible “catalyst.”

# Design: Data Visuals (current state & iterations)

### Visual 1 — Regional Housing Price Index (2018–2025)
- **Type**: Indexed line chart (Index=100 at 2019).  
- **Why indexed**: enables cross-country comparison regardless of different price levels.  
- **Iteration**: v1 (Uzbekistan only) → v2 (added Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) → v3 (added event annotations in late-2022; improved direct labeling; legend moved to top).  

### Visual 2 — Russian Migrant Arrivals (2019–2024)
- **Type**: Small multiples (3 mini line charts by country) or a stacked area with country toggles.  
- **Why**: clearer to see timing and relative magnitude of spikes; aligns with price timeline in the storyboard.  
- **Iteration**: v1 (single country) → v2 (three small multiples for side-by-side timing alignment) → v3 (consistent x-axis ticks; short annotations).  

### Visual 3 — “Drivers Wall” (Supply & Demand Factors)
- **Demand**: real income index; annual population/urbanization change.  
- **Supply**: building materials cost index; new housing units/stock.  
- **Type**: Four small-multiples line charts (uniform axes, same base year if indexed).  
- **Iteration**: v1 (mixed scales) → v2 (indexed, same time window) → v3 (badge tags: “breakout vs trend” / “tracks trend”).  

### Visual 4 — Alignment Snapshot (Side-by-Side)
- **Left**: migration spike timeline; **Right**: price path with the same vertical guides.  
- **Purpose**: a single glance to grasp temporal proximity (with an explicit “association, not causation” label).  
- **Iteration**: added thin guides and a caption explaining limits.

# User research 

## Target audience
- **Primary**: policy-minded graduate students and early-career analysts.  
- **Secondary**: informed readers in Central Asia (homebuyers, journalists, civic analysts).  
- **Recruiting approach**: five participants – 2 policy peers, 2 general readers, 1 practitioner.  

## Interview script (detailed)
> I ran semi-structured interviews (~15–20 minutes). The goal was to test comprehension, timing interpretation, causality clarity, and reaction to the “drivers wall.” Below is the script:

1. **Warm-up** – “When you hear housing prices in Uzbekistan, what do you think are the main drivers?”  
2. **Story comprehension** – “Skim the first two sections—what’s the story so far in one sentence?”  
3. **Price trend** – “Point out when prices start rising the fastest. What might explain that?”  
4. **Migration flows** – “Look at the migration charts—what stands out, and when?”  
5. **Alignment** – “Compare the two—what relationship do you see?”  
6. **Drivers wall** – “Now scan these four extra charts—do you find them useful, or too much?”  
7. **Causality clarity** – “Do you feel I’m claiming causation, or just showing an association?”  
8. **Credibility** – “What would make you more confident in the story?”  
9. **Usability** – “Was anything confusing, unclear, or visually hard to follow?”  
10. **Close** – “On a scale of 1–5: story clarity, visual clarity, credibility. Why?”

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

### Insights & quotes
1. **Regional context matters (4/5)**  
   > “If Kazakhstan sits between Russia and Uzbekistan, I immediately wonder what happened in Kazakhstan. You can’t skip that part.”  
   → Action: Keep all three countries upfront.  

2. **Migration flows need longer history (3/5)**  
   > “Show me the trend before 2022, otherwise I don’t know if this spike is unusual.”  
   → Action: Extend series to 2019–2024.  

3. **Causality caution (3/5)**  
   > “This looks like correlation. Please keep reminding me you’re not saying one causes the other.”  
   → Action: Persistent ‘Association, not causation’ badge.  

4. **Drivers wall mixed (3/5)**  
   > “Four is fine, more is too much for me.”  
   > “Actually, I’d trust you more if I saw *all* the drivers, even if messy.”  
   → Action: Four main drivers in-line, rest optional appendix.  

5. **Mobile readability**  
   > “On my phone, the labels are tiny.”  
   → Action: increase font sizes, simplify legends.  

| Questions | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| “What’s the story so far?” | “Prices up, migration may be part of it.” | “Clear, but Kazakhstan is missing.” | “Got it, but too much on one slide.” |
| “What stands out in migration charts?” | 2022 spike obvious | Wanted more pre-2020 history | “Kazakhstan’s spike is sharpest.” |
| “Drivers wall useful?” | “Too dense.” | “Useful, shows other angles.” | “Pick top 4.” |
| “Causality?” | “Feels causal, needs caveat.” | “Add explicit disclaimer.” | “Association only, please.” |

# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Regional context important | Keep Uzbekistan/Kazakhstan/Kyrgyzstan comparison upfront, with Index=100 (2019). |
| Longer migration series needed | Extend migration flows to 2019–2024, highlight 2022 spike. |
| Clarify correlation vs causation | Add “Association, not causation” badge + limitations card. |
| Drivers wall balance | Prune to 4 key drivers (income, population, materials cost, housing stock), with badges (“tracks trend” vs “breakout”). |
| Conflicting feedback on density | Keep 4 core drivers in main flow; put extended drivers in appendix. |
| Mobile readability | Increase axis label font size; simplify legends. |
| Credibility | Add methods & sources card below first chart. |

# Reflection
- My scope grew intentionally: from **Uzbekistan-only** to a **regional narrative**.  
- Prototyping multiple chart forms (indexed lines, small multiples, side-by-side) helped me find the clearest views.  
- User research **re-centered the story**: Kazakhstan matters, migration needs a 5-year baseline, and limits must be explicit.  
- Next week, I’ll refine visuals to show **associations clearly**, prune drivers, and tighten design for **clarity on mobile**.  
- For deeper causal proof, more econometric analysis would be required (panel models, lag tests, instruments), but for Part III I stay at the **visual storytelling level**.
