## About Me

Hi! I’m **Amirkhon Khamidov** (he/him).  
I’m a master’s student in **Public Policy & Management** at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College.  

My background is in economics, policy research, and teaching. I’ve worked at think tanks and universities on projects ranging from industrial policy to education reform. I enjoy turning complex datasets into clear, accessible insights that support better decision-making.  

Beyond academics, I’m passionate about connecting people and ideas, and building collaborations between research, policy, and practice.

## What I Hope to Learn

In this course, I want to:  

1. **Strengthen storytelling skills** — learn to match visuals to the decisions audiences need to make.  
2. **Improve design choices** — color, accessibility, chart selection, and clarity of titles.  
3. **Build reproducible workflows** — so every chart is backed by code and can be updated easily.  
4. **Publish interactives** — lightweight, web-ready pieces I can share in a portfolio.  
5. **Practice critique and iteration** — improve work by learning from peers and feedback.  

After graduation, I hope to work in policy research and government, using visualization to bring evidence to life for leaders and citizens.
