# TSWD Portfolio (CMU Heinz)

This is my public portfolio for **Telling Stories with Data** at Carnegie Mellon University. It’s my public-facing work folder where I’ll collect examples, workshop materials, and document progress on my final project. I’ll maintain it throughout the course so it can serve as a record of what I learned and something I can share with future collaborators or employers.

## About me

Hi! I’m **Amirkhon Khamidov**, a master’s student in **Public Policy & Management** at CMU Heinz College. I’m passionate about evidence-based policymaking, public-interest technology, and clear, ethical data visualization.

Before Heinz, I worked on regional and macroeconomic analysis—building dashboards, running econometric models (Stata/R/Python), and translating results into practical recommendations. I like taking messy datasets, structuring them, and turning them into visuals that help people decide what to do next.

Outside of coursework, I enjoy teaching and collaborating on research, especially projects related to economic development and social policy.

## What I hope to learn

In this course I want to:

- **Tell clearer stories with data**—tight framing, intentional chart choice, strong titles, and just-enough annotation.  
- **Design responsibly**—accessibility, color choices, uncertainty, and avoiding misleading encodings.  
- **Build reproducible workflows**—from raw data to publication-ready charts (R/Python), and simple web-ready outputs.  
- **Critique effectively**—give and receive constructive feedback, and iterate quickly.  
- **Publish interactives**—lightweight, maintainable pieces I can host in this portfolio.

**After graduating**, I plan to work on data-driven public policy—using analysis and visualization to improve decisions in government or policy research organizations.

### Creating a new page

1. Create a new Markdown file (e.g., `dataviz1.md`).  
2. Link to it from this page using:
   - `[title](dataviz1)` (for internal Markdown)
   - `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` (for external links)

Check links from your **public URL**, not just the preview.
